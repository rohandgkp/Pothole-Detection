# Pothole-Detection

- Used Roboflow to create a custom segmentation model for road pothole detection, enhancing visualization by drawing polylines instead of masks for each pothole. 
- The annotation process was done using Roboflow to build a comprehensive dataset of road potholes and tested the model on various video files for accurate detection.
